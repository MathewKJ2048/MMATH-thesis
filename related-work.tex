A paper by A Cunha (todo: cite this from the journal it was published in, not the arXiv preprint) compares the performance of Alloy and TLA+ implementations of the spanning tree algorithm (used in cite Blast paper). The authors constructed a model of the algorithm by hand for both languages, and compared the performance of the TLA+ implementation with the Alloy implementation. They concluded that in general, TLA+ outperforms Alloy when dealing with simple configurations with large scopes, while Alloy is more suitable for models with complex configurations whose validity takes a non-trivial amount of work by the model-checker to prove. The findings of this paper were limited to a single model, written manually in both languages. The thesis involves comparing Alloy models to their machine-translated TLA+ models.
